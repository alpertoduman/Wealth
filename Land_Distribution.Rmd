# Land Wealth Distribution in Turkey

There exist no study on wealth distribution on Turkey due to lack of data.
There are no tax records data, no inheritance data and no survey of wealth.
In order to examine the wealth distribution in Turkey we use land assets as a proxy for wealth.

## Data Source and Data Preparation

We scrape data from a commercial website and gather data on land sales in Turkey for the period of the first half of March 2021.


## Results

Overall we get more than 88 thousand unique sales, location and price data.
In terms of overall gini in land we find 0.8 and gini in price 0.89.

Moreover we calculate the top 1% share and get 39.4%.
The share of 0.1% is also very high at 14.47%.

## Discussion and Conclusion

The wealth inequality is among the highest in the world.
